# 0.7.1 - 2016-02-15

  will no longer be translated into Refract and instead expose errors for the
  validation failures.

# 0.6.2 - 2016-01-13

- Bad JSON references (using `$ref`) are now returned as parse result
  annotations that include source maps which point to the `$ref` line, making
  debugging easier.

# 0.6.1 - 2016-01-11

- Fix handling of resource `href`, which could get overwritten while processing transitions and result in missing parameters in the URI template.
- Code refactoring

  - Parsing is now handled by a class to more easily share state between various methods. This lays the framework for more refactoring and code cleanup.
  - The parser shared state tracks the path of the component currently being parsed, which makes it easier to split pieces of the parser into separate methods.
  - YAML AST lookup paths are now arrays of strings rather than strings of period-separated components, which made escaping very difficult.
  - Rather than guessing the YAML type, the AST lookup now checks and handles it accordingly. Paths like `'foo.bar.0.baz'` would fail previously and now work (but are passed as `['foo', 'bar', '0', 'baz']`).
  - Underscore is now replaced with Lodash for consistency with other modules.
